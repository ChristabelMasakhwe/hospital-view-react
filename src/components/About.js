            <p><span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>HospiView</span> enables easier and faster way
for patients or others in need of 
some form of health care. We enable patients to access
hospitals with available room for inpatient admissions
and make bookings for a bed with the help of a healthcare provider in
cases of referrals and known admissions cases which can be done by
the patient him/herself.</p>
<p>This bridges the gap of overcrowded hospitals and delayed recovery of patients due to
    unfavourable hospital conditions. This also helps healthcare providers to have a sizeable quantity of patients
    to be able to give quality care.
